# Dynamic CPU Frequency Scaling for DPDK Polling Workloads

## Overview

- This feature dynamically adjusts CPU frequency for DPDK polling applications based on the
[DPDK Telemetry](https://doc.dpdk.org/guides/howto/telemetry.html) `/eal/lcore/usage` metric.
The Cluster Power Manager (CPM) samples per‑CPU usage exposed by the DPDK telemetry socket,
computes a windowed utilization for each CPU, and steers the CPU frequency to keep that
utilization near a target band.
- Actuation is done through the Linux cpufreq subsystem using the `userspace` governor, which
allows CPM to set explicit target frequencies.
- To use this feature with a DPDK application, the application must register a callback for a
standard DPDK telemetry endpoint (/eal/lcore/usage). An
[example callback](https://github.com/DPDK/dpdk/blob/95e85ea4d65d74655217166012896fc5d0b40a4e/app/test-pmd/testpmd.c#L2383)
can be found in the DPDK test-pmd application.

## How it works

### Configuration parameters

Scaling behavior is configured in the `PowerProfile` under `spec.cpuScalingPolicy`. For example:

```yaml
apiVersion: power.cluster-power-manager.github.io/v1alpha1
kind: PowerProfile
metadata:
  name: dpdk-scaling
spec:
  pstates:
    governor: userspace
    min: 0%
    max: 100%
  cpuScalingPolicy:
    workloadType: polling-dpdk
    samplePeriod: 20ms
    cooldownPeriod: 60ms
    targetUsage: 80
    allowedUsageDifference: 5
    allowedFrequencyDifference: 10
    scalePercentage: 100
    fallbackFreqPercent: 0
```

- `workloadType`: must be `polling-dpdk` to enable this feature for a profile.
- `samplePeriod`: interval at which the agent samples usage and decides whether to adjust CPU frequency.
- `cooldownPeriod`: waiting time after a frequency change before another adjustment for the same CPU is considered.
- `targetUsage`: desired usage percentage for each managed CPU.
- `allowedUsageDifference`: deadband around the target; when usage is within this band, the scaler holds the current target.
- `allowedFrequencyDifference`: minimum step (MHz) required to actually apply a computed change.
- `scalePercentage`: proportional gain (10–200). Higher values react more aggressively to error.
- `fallbackFreqPercent`: target frequency percentage when a usage sample is not available.

### Frequency adjustment flow

1. A guaranteed pod requesting a `PowerProfile` with `workloadType: polling-dpdk` is reconciled by the PowerPod controller.
2. The controller ensures a telemetry worker is created per DPDK pod to connect to its telemetry socket and sample cumulative `busy/total` cycle counters at a fixed internal window (≈10 ms). The worker computes windowed usage per CPU and stores the latest sample in a thread‑safe map.
3. For each managed CPU, a scaling worker evaluates control every `samplePeriod`:
   - Reads the latest windowed usage.
   - If usage is within `targetUsage ± allowedUsageDifference`, hold the current target.
   - Otherwise, compute a new target with the proportional rule below, clamp to limits, and apply if it exceeds `allowedFrequencyDifference`.
   - After applying, wait `cooldownPeriod` before evaluating that CPU again.

#### Windowed usage computation

The `/eal/lcore/usage` endpoint exposes cumulative counters. To base decisions on recent activity, the telemetry worker derives a per‑CPU windowed usage over its fixed sampling window.

`total_cycles[i]` and `busy_cycles[i]` are cumulative. On each poll, compute deltas against the previous sample:

```console
delta_total = total_cycles[i]_now - total_cycles[i]_prev
delta_busy  = busy_cycles[i]_now  - busy_cycles[i]_prev
delta_usage% = 100 * delta_busy / delta_total   # clamped to [0, 100]
```

#### Frequency update formula

```console
nextTargetFrequency = currentFrequency * (1 + (currentUsage / targetUsage - 1) * scalePercentage)
```

Then apply filters and limits:

- If `|nextTargetFrequency - previousTarget| < allowedFrequencyDifference`, hold the previous target.
- If usage is within the allowed range, hold the previous target.
- Clamp to configured min/max (`pstates.min/max`).
- Set the new target via cpufreq `userspace`, then wait `cooldownPeriod` before reevaluating that CPU.

## Testing and monitoring

1. Apply a PowerProfile with a scaling policy (see example above) to the cluster where you will run the DPDK app.

2. Launch the example DPDK server/client pair:

    ```console
    ./testbin/dpdk-testapp.sh [--non-siblings] [--replicas N]
    ```

    - The script deploys [examples/example-dpdk-testapp.yaml](../examples/example-dpdk-testapp.yaml) and starts two `dpdk-testpmd` instances in each pod: a client (traffic generator) and a server (receiver/forwarder). The scaler manages the CPUs assigned to the server container.
    - If Hyper-Threading is enabled, pass `--non-siblings` to pin the server to one logical CPU per physical core. If HT is disabled, omit the flag.
    - To launch multiple DPDK pods, pass `--replicas N` (default: 1). Each pod gets its own DPDK telemetry connection and CPU scaling.

3. Monitor frequency and usage on the node with [cpmon.py](../testbin/cpmon.py). Copy the script to the target node and run it there, as it reads CPU sysfs and MSR data locally:

    ```sh
    # On the target node:
    export KUBECONFIG=<path-to-kubeconfig>
    NODE=$(hostname)
    POD="<pod-name>"
    CPUS=$(oc get powernodestate "$NODE-power-state" -n power-manager -o jsonpath="{range .status.cpuPools.exclusive[?(@.pod==\"$POD\")]}{range .powerContainers[?(@.name==\"server\")]}{.cpuIDs}{end}{end}" | tr -d '[]')
    PODID=$(oc get powernodestate "$NODE-power-state" -n power-manager -o jsonpath="{range .status.cpuPools.exclusive[?(@.pod==\"$POD\")]}{.podUID}{end}")
    ./cpmon.py --cpu "$CPUS" --dpdk-pod-uid "$PODID" [--no-siblings] [--scroll]
    ```

4. To tear down the DPDK test app:

    ```console
    ./testbin/dpdk-testapp.sh -d
    ```
